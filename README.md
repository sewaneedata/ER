# Background tab

This tab explores the background research that influenced the creation of our project. It walks the user through 

- Background research on ER overuse in the United States with stats, 
- What ER overuse is, 
- Why we care about exploring ER overuse on the South Cumberland Plateau,
- What our partner wants to gain from our project, and
- Important vocabulary.

# Primary Findings tab

This tab explores some of our primary findings. It consists of four static graphs that explore the following:

- ER overuse on the South Cumberland Plateau,
- ER overuse in Williamson county, the "healthiest" county in Tennessee, versus on the SCP,
- ER overuse by insurance type, and
- Visits to the ER at differenet times of day for both "appropriate" and "overuse" reasons.

All static graphs are accompanied by summaries of what they show.

# Explore ER Overuse dropdown tab

This tab is a dropdown tab where the user can play around in the data. 

**All instructions for how to operate the tools in these tabs are in the dashboard.**

The tabs included in here are as follows:

**Map:** Outlines the South Cumberland Plateau and expresses severity of ER overuse by zip code. Urgent cares in the area are indicated by red dots, while primary care doctors (ONLY) on the Plateau are indicated by green dots. Blue markers represent the top ten most visited ERs by residents from the Plateau.
The other map is interactive and shows the top three hospitals visited by residents from a specifuc zip code.

**Demographics:** This tab explores trends in ER use based on demographics of Sex, Race, and Age group. The user can choose to investigate trends in ER use based on these demographics by zip code, county, and insurance type.

**Types of Conditions:** This tab explores the rate at which residents of the SCP visit the ER for certain types of conditions. Types of conditions include:
- ACS, 
- non-emergent, 
- mental health, 
- dental, and
- substance abuse conditions.

**Top Diagnoses:** This tab explores the top 5 diagnoses seen at the ER in instances of overuse in different zip codes, counties, and by insurance type.
