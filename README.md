# Investigating ER Overuse

DataLab Summer 2022 Project

## Problem Statement:
Grundy County is defined as a Medically Underserved Area (MUA) by the Health Resources and Services Administration. This means that the county lacks the health care services required to adequately meet community needs. Research has shown that across the U.S. in rural MUAs, citizens are increasingly seeking primary care at ERs. Due to trends such as these, our partner, the South Cumberland Health Network (SCHN), believes that analyzing ER discharge data may offer helpful insight into _how_ Grundy County is medically underserved. Our team’s objective is to create an interactive dashboard that expresses trends in ER discharge data from the South Cumberland Plateau to aid the SCHN in creating solutions to Grundy’s health service shortage.

## DataLab Team Introduction
As members of the 2022 DataLab Sewanee Internship, we have dedicated our summer to learning data science and performing data analysis for a client in our local community. Each of us are discouraged by the large medical service gaps seen in Grundy County and Sewanee Community, and passionate about providing data analysis to help South Cumberland Health Network in filling those gaps. These are the members of our team:

- **Ellie Davis**: Rising senior at Sewanee: The University of the South, studying both political science and women’s & gender studies.

- **Kenedi Clinton**: Student-athlete at Sewanee: The University of The South; Class of 2024. Pursuing a Biology major with a Rhetoric minor and a Civic and Global Leadership certificate. Interested in global health, research, data analysis, and graduate school.

- **Jenna Lusk**: Sophomore at Purdue University (Class of 2025) studying Computer Information Technology, with minors in Design & Innovation and Organizational Leadership. 

## Deliverables
### Client Perspective Report

A report which outlines the perspective of the client, South Cumberland Health Network, showing their viewpoint of what the problem it is that we are addressing and what is expected from the DataLab team as a result.

### Goal-setting

A detailed outline of goals for the final product for our client. The goals are separated into two sections: Bare Minimum and Aspirational, which are the goals we wish to achieve once we determine that ERs are being overused. Additionally, each goal is described with what criteria we will use for evaluating their completion.

### Pre-mortem

The Pre-Mortem is a list of issues that could go wrong based on what every member of the group assumes that the project will be a failure. These assumptions are highly specific to the project based on our data set, skills, tools, and knowledge. Here, it is also described what we can do to prevent these issues.
